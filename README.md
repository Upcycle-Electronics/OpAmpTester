# This is a simple Op Amp tester tool designed for checking the basic function of single, dual, and quad op amps with a 
standard pin configuration. The tool tests that the op amp(s) can operate in their linear region and that they are able to
both source and sink current. The design also had an extra dual op amp socket with breakout pins and 2 power configurations.
I designed this circuit for a dual polarity power supply. The version I built uses +/- 5 volts. This design uses a 3 hole
terminal block so test power could be changed easily. This design is built on 2 5x7 perfboards, and is extremely simple. It is
intended to be used to verify the functionality of upcycled and cheaply sourced jellybean parts.
